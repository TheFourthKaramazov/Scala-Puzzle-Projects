# Sodoku Solver Programs in Scala using backtracking algorithm


## sodokuSolver:

This script uses imperative programming in Scala to solve a sodoku board with a backtracking algorithm. Simply change the array to any 9X9 sodoku board and the program will solve the board. If it is not solvable (not a valid board) the script will output that result as well

Run: amm ~/file path/filename.sc or scala ~/file path/filename.sc"

## sodokuSolverFunctional:

This script uses functional programming in Scala to solve a sodoku board with a backtracking algorithm. Simply change the array to any 9X9 sodoku board and the program will solve the board. If it is not solvable (not a valid board) the script will output that result as well.
